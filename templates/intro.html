    <h1>Welcome to the File Upload API</h1>
    <p>This API allows clients to upload files to the server.</p>
    <p>Use this route as a endpoint to send a file via a POST request.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>1️⃣ Make sure that <strong>server.py</strong> is running on <strong>Computer A</strong>.</p>
    <p>2️⃣ Make sure that <strong>client.py</strong> is running on <strong>Computer B</strong>.</p>
    <p>3️⃣ To upload a file from Computer B to Computer A, run the following command on Computer B:</p>

    <code>python -m app.client &lt;file_path&gt;</code>

    <p>Also, ensure that both computers have the <strong>same IP address configuration</strong> to make the upload successful.</p>
